1. Look into how the shader is handled in this example
2. Look into how the texture is handled in this example
3. Try again the wrapping mode "clamp"
4. Try to load a different image
5. Create a second "AnimatedMesh". This time, animate it the same way without reuploading the vertex buffer every frame.
   Hint: Uniforms in the shader.
